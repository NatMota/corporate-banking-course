Abstract: Credit risk presents the probability of loss that the company incurs in the event of a business partner (the counterparty) default. The default may occur if the liabilities are not met under the terms of the contract which in turn results into the loss of the company (the creditor). Specifically, the liabilities arose from the credit, trade or investment activities, payment system and trade settlement. Difficulties in credit risk modelling arise due to the fact that the company default is not a frequent phenomenon but it occurs mainly unexpectedly. However, if the default occurs, it often causes the creditors major losses which size cannot be quantified in advance. The issue of modelling and quantification of credit risk is the subject of interest of many studies, scientific articles and publications. The access of individual authors to the present issue is diverse and so the methodology used for this purpose is not uniform. The present contribution will address the analysis and comparison of four basic approaches of description, but especially the quantification of credit risk: CreditRisk+, Credit Metrics, Merton model and Credit Grades. The comparison will be made on the basis of the computer performance, the applicability to different types of companies (public or non-public tradable), the volatility of credit events, thecorrelation of credit events occurrence, the required input data, currency of data and such like. Conclusions and recommendations for the application of the various approaches in specific situations will be parts of the contribution.

Credit risk measurement: Developments over
the last 20 years
Edward I. Altman, Anthony Saunders *

This paper traces developments in the credit risk measurement literature over the last
20 years. The paper is essentially divided into two parts. In the ®rst part the evolution of
the literature on the credit-risk measurement of individual loans and portfolios of loans
is traced by way of reference to articles appearing in relevant issues of the Journal of
Banking and Finance and other publications. In the second part, a new approach built
around a mortality risk framework to measuring the risk and returns on loans and
bonds is presented. This model is shown to oer some promise in analyzing the risk-return
structures of portfolios of credit-risk exposed debt instruments. Ó

BIS Working Papers
No 116
Credit risk measurement and
procyclicality
by Philip Lowe
Monetary and Economic Department
September 2002

Abstract
This paper examines the two-way linkages between credit risk
measurement and the macroeconomy. It first discusses the issue of
whether credit risk is low or high in economic booms. It then reviews
how macroeconomic considerations are incorporated into credit risk
models and the risk measurement approach that underlies the New
Basel Capital Accord. Finally, it asks what effect these
measurement approaches are likely to have on the macroeconomy,
particularly through their role in influencing the level of bank capital.
The paper argues that much remains to be done in integrating
macroeconomic considerations into risk measurement, particularly
during the upswing of business cycles that are characterised by
rapid increases in credit and asset prices. It also suggests that a
system of risk-based capital requirements is likely to deliver large
changes in minimum requirements over the business cycle,
particularly if risk measurement is based on market prices. This has
the potential to increase the financial amplification of business
cycles, although other aspects of risk-based capital requirements
are likely to work in the other direction. Further work on evaluating
the net effects is important for both supervisory and monetary
authorities.

Credit Risk Measurement in Financial Institutions: Going Beyond
Regulatory Compliance
Marios N. Kyriacou†

Abstract
Capital adequacy is an important factor considered by financial institutions when
they formulate their lending policy and balance sheet growth strategy. The
majority of financial institutions employ the Standardised Approach for
calculating their credit risk capital requirements as they cannot meet the stringent
criteria stipulated in Basel II (and Basel III) and qualify for the more advanced
approaches. The Standardised Approach lacks the necessary risk sensitivity and
the resulting regulatory capital requirements serve as a very crude proxy of the
actual credit risk taken. Strategic decision making based on this approach, often
provides institutions with a perverse incentive for pursuing (a) collateral-driven
lending policies rather than focusing on obligor financial standing and repayment
ability; (b) balance sheet short-term growth strategies where excess liquidity takes
the form of high-yield government bond investments. This paper presents two
simplified credit risk models that are not data demanding and, by addressing the
very weaknesses of the Standardised Approach, more informative in measuring
the possible future loss impact of credit risky business or investment decisions. It
provides a comparative analysis of the presented models with empirical results
suggesting that financial institutions would need to do more than simply
maintaining compliance with the minimum regulatory capital requirements.
Keywords: Capital allocation, Capital requirements regulations, Credit risk
measurement, Eurozone banking crisis, Value-at-Risk (VaR).

Abstract: Credit risk is defined as that risk of financial loss caused by failure by the counterparty. According to statistics, for financial institutions, credit risk is much important than market risk, reduced diversification of the credit risk is the main cause of bank failures. Just recently, the banking industry began to measure credit risk in the context of a portfolio along with the development of risk management started with models value at risk (VAR). Once measured, credit risk can be diversified as any other financial risk. The main purpose of the paper is to present the most important methods of credit risk measurement used in the banking industry: Credit Metrics, developed by J.P. Morgan, Portfolio Manager developed by KMV company, Credit Risk+ developed by Credit Suisse First Boston and Credit Portfolio View developed by the consultancy company McKinsey.
Keywords: credit risk; models; management; strategy
